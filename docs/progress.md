The ```docs``` folder involves two major meeting about the project to determine the direction of the prohect. 

-- First in the meeting of Kai and Sourav in Oct. 2023, they determined that the PETS should focus on canned pattern for pattern suggestion problem for large-scale attribute graph. The idea is similar to the "AutoG" paper (VLDBJ 2017), which developed a pattern auto-completetion framework for graph databases.

The ```docs/paper``` contains some relevant papers.
